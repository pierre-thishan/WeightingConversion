#digital-value-multimeter-using-weighting-conversion

In this program with an External DAC and using the circuit board TM4C1294 (https://www.ti.com/product/TM4C1294NCPDT ) we find the value of an external analog voltage 
value using the "Weighted Conversion Method" as a digital value. 
This digital value (four digits eg-12.34) is then displayed using a BCD display.
